        The purpose of this template is to suggest a new feature or enhancement to specific areas of Backstage, or the Backstage ecosystem as a whole. You do not need to fill in all sections, but the better the information, the greater the chance that you will receive the desired response.

        If this is a very advanced or large addition, you might want to consider creating a [Backstage Enhancement Proposal (BEP)](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/beps/README.md) instead, as that process has better facilitation of discussions around details of the proposal. Don't worry though, you can always convert the issue in to a BEP later.
