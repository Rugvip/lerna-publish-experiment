        This template helps you propose new features or enhancements for Backstage. You can keep your proposal lightweight, but please provide enough detail for reviewers to understand and respond effectively.

        For complex additions, consider creating a [Backstage Enhancement Proposal](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/beps/README.md) (BEP) instead, as this process streamlines discussions and iteration. Don't worry - you can always convert this issue to a BEP later.

        Provide sufficient detail for reviewers to give concrete feedback.

        Including a proposed implementation is optional, but if you do, consider adding design details such as TypeScript examples, database schema, or sequence diagrams.

        If the change requires particular care when being rolled out, it can be helpful to for example include a plan for a phased release.
